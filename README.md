# M4DS_PROJECT2


We chose categorical-crossentropy loss function because we got maximum accuracy using it compared to other loss function models.

1. Initially we clean the data.
1. Missing data was replaced by mean of group for continous and mode of group for categorical variables. 
1. we replaced categorical variables by corresponding data value basically we converted to string data values to integer data values 
1. we standardized the data using standard scalar function
1. Then we split the data for training and testing
1. Then we build the model
